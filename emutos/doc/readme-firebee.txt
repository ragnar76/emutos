http://didierm.pagesperso-orange.fr/firebee.htm
Get it from the tos060.lzh archive, tos060/flash.too foder.
On your FireBee, start FireTOS, run FLASH060.PRG and flash emutosfb.s19.

In both cases, the correct EmuTOS flash parameters are prefilled,
you don't need to change anything.

To start EmuTOS on the FireBee, you have 2 options.

1) Put the DIP switch #5 down and DIP switch #6 up. This is the preferred
method, EmuTOS will be started directly from the BaS in fully native mode.

2) Start FireTOS. At the very beginning, a boot menu appears. Select 2 - EMUTOS.
This will run EmuTOS over FreeRTOS and enable extra features, such as support
for USB keyboard and mouse.

- NVRAM boot resolution is currently ignored, 640x480x16 is always used
- Experimental IDE support is enabled for the internal CompactFlash slot
