EmuTOS is partially derived from Digital Research's original GEMDOS 1.1
operating system and GEM GUI.
EmuTOS is basically made up of seven parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The BIOS, which is the basic input output system</li>
  <li>The XBIOS, which provides the interface to the hardware</li>
  <li>The BDOS, which are the high level OS routines, what you know as GEMDOS</li>
  <li>The shell command.prg we use as an alternative to GEM</li>
  <li>The VDI, which provides an abstracted device interface</li>
  <li>The AES, which does all the higher level graphics stuff and</li>
  <li>The Desktop - the program you see immediately after boot</li>
</ul>
<p>
GEMDOS was first used in Apple's Lisa computer, and later, as
home computers came up, in Atari ST series. In both GEMDOS were the base
for Digital Research's GEM graphical user interface, which became very
popular with the introduction of the Atari ST.
</p>
<p>
In 1999 Caldera bought all the GEM and GEMDOS stuff from DRI and
thought of using it as a base for some thinclients. But this never
happened and they decided to release GEMDOS together with GEM under the
GPL (GNU General Public License).
</p>
<p>
In spring of 2001 we began to work on these old sources and had some
good progress till today.
</p>
<p>
The BIOS and XBIOS code is our own development. It is really written
from scratch and implements nearly all of the TOS 1.0 BIOS
functionality, and a bit more, like e.g. hard disk access and STe sampled
sound. A few things like printing, midi and serial stuff is missing for
now, but may be implemented in the future.
</p>
<p>
The GEMDOS part is based on Digital Research's GEMDOS sources, which
were made available under GPL license in 1999 by Caldera. Also all of
the graphical parts, the VDI, AES and desktop, which are now nearly
completely implemented. Though, many parts of these subsystems have been
changed or rewritten to be more compatible and conforming with modern
TOS developments.
</p>
<p>
Of course, being a single-user and single-tasking OS, EmuTOS can not compete with
other modern operating systems that are available today. In the TOS world, all
of GEMDOS has been replaced by a superior operating system called FreeMiNT
(MiNT Is Now TOS).
This is widely used in the Atari ST and TT series computers today. FreeMiNT
is is more POSIX-like and provides most modern concepts, like a multi-user
environment, symmetric multitasking, memory protection and so on.
</p>
<p>
But since EmuTOS provides the same functionality as the original TOS and the
code is lean enough to fit within less than 256 KB ROM, it is a perfect
replacement for the original TOS. So when talking about EmuTOS, maybe rather
think about a cool firmware replacement for TOS compatible machines instead of a
full-blown operating system.
