- Changing the VDI color palette is not possible on TT and Falcon.
- PROCALC.ACC doesn't open after changing the resolution.
- Desktop doesn't use the _IDT date separator.
- Drag-and-drop does not work in the freeware GEM games "Abalone"
  "Hotshot checkers", "Risky", "Yukon" and in the shareware solitair
  game "Patience".
- Mouse buttons don't work properly in several GEM programs:
  - In "Sysinfo" (v5.02) dialog buttons and window scrollbar buttons
    are selected only on mouse button release and acted only if
    press and release are within certain time of each other.
    http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=28236630
  - In PixArt4, buttons within windows don't react to mouse clicks,
    only window close button does
  - In "Patience", all the dialogs (quit, start new game) show
    the button selected last time still as selected and it needs
    to be unselected to use the dialog.
  - "Awele" v1.01 window menus close immediately after clicking to open
    them.  "Awele" v1.02 compiled with newer Windom version works fine.
  - In (original) "Ballerburg", when not in a dialog, there are constant
    "ding" sounds and moving mouse over interactive elements activates
    them without a click.
  - Clicks don't work at all in "Yams" (mine sweeper) game.
  - In "Bombs" & "Mind Sweeper" (mine sweeper) games, it's pretty
    random whether mouse clicks go through, mostly they don't.
- 6x6 font is missing characters 1->31, 194->223 and 255.
  The character 158 is wrong.  As a result small arrows don't
  show up in "Clac" RSC.
- Text in the log window of ImCon GEM image converter is double
  the correct size on ST low and med resolutions.
- The right side of outline characters are clipped, e.g. in
  "LaserChess", "Diamond miner" and "Minigolf" games.  In vditext
  tester their line height is also too low:
  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29276993
- Text input in GFA programs like "Minigolf" (which dont' use GEM)
  always goes to the top left corner of screen, not to the position
  where it goes with normal TOS.
- Game result text in "Sherlock" is positioned wrong (overlaps).
- Thick arcs going partly outside of screen have incorrectly
  drawn pixels at top of screen in vditext tester.  
- In Mario Becroft's GEM Pacman, "game over" melt effect happens
  for the whole screen, not just for the game window.
- '-' key for moving left in VDI "Invaders" and 'h' & 'j' keys
  for moving character left & right in Anduril don't work, only
  special key (Alt/Shift) input works:
  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29277643
- Box drawing in Gl"ucksrad leaves garbage on top of screen
  and player name input text isn't shown.
- In "MathMaze", game win dialog leaves some lines on screen.
- Monopoly game board isn't drawn properly, maybe due to issues
  in filled polylines.
- Ramses game panics after Mediach() if floppy is missing:
  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29277256
- 7UP hangs on exit.
